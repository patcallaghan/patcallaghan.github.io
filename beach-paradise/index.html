      <p>Nestled on the northern end of the Isle of Caludge, this beach is cited
      as the most popular getaway for vacationers during peak summer months. Popular
      activites include scuba diving, snorkeling, and bird wathcing.</p>

      <h3>Selange Beach</h3>
      <p>Selange Beach is known for its temperature sand. Made upd of ground coral
      due to thousands of years of tectonic activity, the sand is always cool <tbody>
      the touch, despite the heat. The western portion includes fantastic flora
      and fauna and many pre-Columbian ruins.</p>

      alt="Hunt Lagoon">
      <h3>Hunt Lagoon</h3>
      <p>Known primarily for it's hidden location on Kamar Island (which includes
      swimming through an underground cave), Hunt Lagoon offers a peaceful respite
      from the tourist-laden locations found throughout Kamar. If possible, make a
      visit at night - it's bioluminescent lagoon is like viewing fireworks in the
      water!</p>

    <div id="moat">

      alt="Moat Lagoon">
      <h3>Moat Lagoon</h3>
      <p>Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon. This is one of the most
      difficult beach locations to access. The lagoon is located inside of
      a prehistoric cenote, or underground aquifer. Accessing it involves crossing
      the moat surrounding the lagoon (hence the name) with locals by kayak. Once
      there, marvel at the phenomenal (and endangered) quetzal bird and its golden
      feathers</p>
